"""Shared YAML-loading safety net against alias-bomb ("billion laughs"-style) documents.

PyYAML's ``SafeLoader`` supports YAML anchors/aliases (``&anchor`` / ``*alias``): an alias reuses
the SAME already-constructed Python object its anchor built. That is fine for one level, but
NESTED anchors (``&a [*b, *b]`` referencing ``&b [*c, *c]`` referencing ..., N levels deep) let a
tiny document expand into an EXPONENTIAL structure the moment anything walks or stringifies it
(``str()``, string concatenation, recursive serialization) — a few hundred bytes of frontmatter can
turn into tens of millions of characters and seconds of CPU, on the shared event loop, before a
single byte is ever written to disk. `core.skills` and `core.rulepacks` both call `str(...)` on
raw `yaml.safe_load` output (frontmatter `name`, `alias:`/`set_keys:` entries) and are both
LLM-authored-content parse targets (`agent.forge`), so both need the same rejection.

This module is the ONE place that rejects aliases, so every caller (`core.skills`,
`core.rulepacks`, `agent.forge`) gets identical behavior instead of each maintaining its own
loader subclass. Nothing here ever ``eval``/``exec``s anything: `NoAliasSafeLoader` is a plain
`yaml.SafeLoader` that additionally refuses `&anchor`/`*alias` nodes outright, at the point an
alias is FIRST composed — before any expansion happens, not after the tree is already built.
