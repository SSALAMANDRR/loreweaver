"""Per-room Scribe coordinator: one ordered chain, lifecycle cancel, snapshot refresh.

The post-turn Scribe is fire-and-forget so the just-finished reply can leave the
room without waiting on a bookkeeping model call. That latency hide is load-bearing
and stays — and it is why the NEXT turn does not wait for it either: making turn
N+1 park on turn N's Scribe (plus its Director call and its image) would move all
of that latency back onto the table, one turn later. What fire-and-forget must not
also hide is *order*:

- two same-room passes scheduled while the previous LLM is still out can finish
  out of wall-clock order and write the earlier turn's trackers over the later one;
- ``.undo`` / ``.reset`` / import / delete / ``.save load`` could restore or wipe
  the room under a running pass, which then wrote the abandoned state back;
- ``run_kp_turn`` photographed the room *before* the pass, so a successful
  Scribe/Director write sat in no turn-boundary snapshot.

This module is the single in-process owner of that chain. It lives in ``agent/``
so the keeper-lane prompt site (``agent.loop``) and the undo restore can call it
without a gateway/net reverse import. The two operations have two homes, not a
copy in every command:

- **schedule** — ``gateway.turn`` after a player turn's reply has already streamed;
- **cancel-and-drain** — ``agent.undo.restore`` and the four ``net.room_backup``
  mutations, *before* they touch documents or room_state.

Companion sub-turns re-enter the turn flow inside the same player turn, and the
player's pass already sees the whole exchange. They *do* advance the chronicle
counter, which is why a completed pass refreshes the snapshot named by the
*current* counter, never the player turn's ``result.turn`` — and why it stands
down when that counter has moved past the turn it was scheduled on: a newer turn
owns that boundary now.
