"""AI-KP tools for Layer B.3: the self-extension engines (`agent.forge`).

`ForgeTools` exposes the three `generate_*` tools -- `generate_skill` (B.3a), `generate_rulepack`
and `generate_module` (B.3b) -- and all three are `gated=True` (Layer B.2 -- see `agent.tools.tool`
and `docs/plugins.md` "Layer B"): hidden from the model's toolset and refused on dispatch unless
the room has enabled the matching forge skill (`skill-forge`/`rule-forge`/`module-forge`, whose
`allowed-tools:` is what unlocks each one). A fresh install can never have the AI Keeper author and
install new skills/rule systems/modules on its own initiative -- the keeper must opt in first.
