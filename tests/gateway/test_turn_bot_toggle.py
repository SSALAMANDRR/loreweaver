"""`.bot off` mutes the AI Keeper on the hub/TUI path (`gateway.turn._kp_enabled`).

A human-Keeper table needs the KP to stay quiet on plain chat while dice
commands keep working; `.bot on`/unset keeps today's KP-answers-everything
behavior. (The chat adapters gate earlier, in `GatewayRunner.on_inbound`.)
