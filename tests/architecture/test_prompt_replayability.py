"""M23 WS3: whatever reaches the model must be reconstructable from persisted state.

Two model-visible inputs used to exist only in process memory: `hooks.js` injections
(stashed on `ctx.extra` and read straight back) and the worldbook's `{{random}}`/
`{{pick}}` macros plus its `probability` rolls, which drew from an unseeded
`random.Random()`. Undo replay, join replay, playtest forensics and the behavioural
evals were all silently missing part of what the model actually saw.

This is not byte-identity worship — it is an explicit contract with a short, written
exemption list. A new prompt segment has to answer "how does this replay?" to get past
CI, and "it doesn't, because X" is a legitimate answer as long as X is written down.

The scan looks for the three ways a prompt input escapes persistence:

1. **unseeded randomness** — every generator in the assembler must be seeded from
   persisted state (`agent.prompt_builder.turn_rng`);
2. **the wall clock** — a prompt that reads real time cannot be rebuilt tomorrow;
3. **process-memory handoffs** — anything read off `ctx.extra` must name the row that
   records it, or be exempt with a reason.
