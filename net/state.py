"""Build the WebSocket `state` frame's payload for one room (M4 spec §1).

`build_room_state` is a read-only snapshot: the caller's own active
character, the shared party roster, the game clock, the initiative order,
the current scene, and the room's rolling LLM token/cache usage. Every piece
is independently optional — a brand-new room has none of them yet — so a
missing/unset piece is simply left out of the returned dict (or reduced to
an empty list for `party`/`initiative`) instead of raising, letting
`net.tui_server.TuiServer` call this unconditionally on join and after
every turn.

`online` is left at `0` here: a room's live connection count (and which
party members are currently connected) is `TuiServer`'s concern, not this
module's — the server overlays the real numbers before broadcasting.

`resolve_active_character` (below) is the single, canonical "what character is
this caller playing right now" lookup: `gateway.turn._display_name` (the turn
echo's actor name) reuses it too, rather than re-implementing the same
lookup + `"default"`-sentinel fallback a second time, so the echoed actor name
and this module's `state.character` can never diverge on the same caller.
